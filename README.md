Chrome extension to hide YouTube feed, comments and sidebar recommended videos

Go to [Installation](#installation) to skip the rant

## Rant

If you are like me you have been using YouTube a lot. 
Sometimes you consume content that builds up your knowledge about new topics. 
Other times you watch the obligatory kitten video of the day. 
Occationally you get to witness people smacking their heads really hard,
in their quest to become the next Darwin Award contenders.

Also if you are like me you may have followed the YouTube's **rabbit hole** of
video recommendations and thought countless times:
> But I only wanted to watch one useful video. Where did my evening go?

The problem with YouTube recommendations is that they are *too good*. 
Their effectiveness is 5% due to YouTube's algorithm, 10% to the law 
of large numbers and the vast 85% to yours, and mine, wild case of serial 
procrastrination.

This chrome plugin takes care of the problem by eliminating YouTube feed 
and the sidebar recommendations.

**Bonus feature**: This plugin also hides the hated YouTube comments section.
If you like YouTube comments this app is not for you. Move along.
