# youtube-no-recommend
Chrome extension to hide YouTube feed, comments and sidebar recommended videos

Go to [Installation](#installation) to skip the rant

## Rant

If you are like me you have been using YouTube a lot, sometimes to consume content that 
will build up your knowledge about new topics and sometimes to watch the obligatory 
kitten video of the day or to watch someone smack their head in their journey to
becoming a Darwin Award contender.

Also if you are like me you may have followed the YouTube recommended video rabbit hole
and thought countless times:
> But I only wanted to watch one useful video. Where did my evening go?

The problem with YouTube recommendations is that they are too good, partly because 
of YouTube's algorithm, partly because of the law of large numbers and partly because
you (like me) are a serial procrastrinator.

This chrome plugin takes care of this for you by hiding the YouTube feed and the sidebar 
recommendations.

Bonus feature: This plugin also hides the hated YouTube comments section.
If you like YouTube comments this app is not for you. Move along.
